## Usage

### Signing up

Commenting, replying, voting, and flagging require a logged in user. You can sign up directly in the plugin, either by attempting to post a comment, or clicking on the avatar button.

Signing up can be done via social login or by email. Email sign ups require email verification.

### Commenting

The plugin supports limited (but compliant) Markdown:
- italic:  
\_text\_ or \*text\* creates _text_
- bold:  
\__text\__ or \**text\** creates __text__
- italic + bold:  
\___text\___ or \***text\*** creates ___text___
- inline quotes:  
\`text\` creates `text`
- block quotes:  
\```  
text  
\```  
creates  
```
text
```
- code (with language-specific styles):  
\```js  
const text = 'text';  
\```  
creates  
```js
const text = 'text';
```

#### Limits
- At this time, links are not automatically hyperlinked. This may change in the future.
- Comments may be up to 16,384 characters in length.
- Comments are editable for 8 minutes.
- You may edit a comment up to 9 times.

### Voting

You may upvote comments to show your support for quality content. This will bubble the comment up higher on the page. Similarly, downvoting comments may push comments further down the page.

### Flagging

If you spot spam or otherwise malicious comments, flagging them will alert moderators to it to take further action.

### Moderation

The plugin supports limited moderation, where moderators may directly remove published comments from it. However, the dashboard is necessary to moderate pending comments, as they do not show up in the plugin.
