## Usage

### Signing up

Commenting, replying, voting, and flagging require a logged in user. You can sign up directly in the plugin, either by attempting to post a comment, or clicking on the avatar button.

Signing up can be done via social login or by email. Email sign ups require email verification.

### Commenting

The plugin supports limited (but compliant) Markdown, supporting [italics](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#italic), [bolding](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#bold), [block quotes](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#blockquotes-1), [code](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#code), and [code blocks](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax#fenced-code-blocks). 

#### Limits

- At this time, links are not automatically hyperlinked. This may change in the future.
- Comments may be up to 16,384 characters in length.
- Comments are editable for 8 minutes.
- You may edit a comment up to 9 times.

### Voting

You may upvote comments to show your support for quality content. This will bubble the comment up higher on the page. Similarly, downvoting comments may push comments further down the page.

### Flagging

If you spot spam or otherwise malicious comments, flagging them will alert moderators to it to take further action.

### Moderation

The plugin supports limited moderation, where moderators may directly remove published comments from it, block users, and pin comments. The dashboard is necessary to moderate pending comments, as they do not show up in the plugin.

#### Remove published comments

Hover on the comment you'd like to remove, and the option to remove will appear.

#### Block users

Click on the avatar of the user you'd like to block, and the option to block them will appear.

#### Pinning comments

"Pinning" a comment keeps it at the top of the level it's in. Pinning top-level comments is a great way to signify importance. To pin a comment, simply hover on the comment you'd like to pin, and the option will appear.
